			<h2>The basics</h2>
			
			<p><strong>Search engine optimization</strong> (SEO) is a set of techniques, concepts, and principles to help you improve your site&rsquo;s ranking in search engine results when people search for keywords related to your site.  Simply put, the main concept of SEO is discovering which keywords people are likely to search for when looking for the type of content your site has, and then using these keywords in the right places on your site to increase its relevance score and therefore place your site higher in the list of search results.</p>
			
			<p>The first result receives the highest <strong>click-through rate</strong> (CTR), and CTRs drop off significantly past the top three results.  Clicks bottom out after ranking position 10; 95% of users never look past the first page of results.</p>
			
			<p>Ranking algorithms look at several factors to determine a site&rsquo;s rank:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Keyword relevance:</strong> how directly relevant the keywords on your site are to the user&rsquo;s search keywords.</li>
				<li><strong>Keyword precision:</strong> whether your keywords are targeted at a specific topic, or you&rsquo;ve simply spammed common keywords across your whole site.</li>
				<li><strong>Incoming links:</strong> how many other sites link to your site, and how relevant those links are. The more authoritative and higher-ranking a site linking to yours is, the more weight its inbound link will have on your own ranking.  (This can be abused with link farm sites that consist entirely of pages full of links to other sites. That&rsquo;s why relevance between your site and those that link to yours is factored in.)</li>
				<li><strong>Update frequency:</strong> sites that regularly publish new, relevant, and high-quality content will often rank higher.</li>
				<li><strong>HTTPS status:</strong> whether your site is served over HTTPS and is secure. Non-secured websites will often rank lower or be excluded completely.</li>
				<li><strong>Loading speed:</strong> sites that load quickly, especially on mobile, will rank higher.</li>
				<li><strong>Mobile friendliness:</strong> sites that are designed to work well on mobile are significantly prioritized.</li>
				<li><strong>Bounce rate and dwell time:</strong> if users go to your site but leave quickly, that&rsquo;s a high bounce rate with a low dwell time, and will lower your overall ranking.</li>
				<li><strong>CTR:</strong> if a site&rsquo;s CTR improves, its position in the rankings will also improve.</li>
				<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> sites that comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG 2.0</a> accessibility guidelines will have a higher rank.  This includes useful alt text, screen reader friendly links and headings, and sufficient color contrast.</li>
				<li><strong>Domain name age:</strong> the majority of top-ten Google search result rankings are three years old or older.  Simply giving your site time to age will help.</li>
				<li><strong>Domain name content:</strong> exact-match domain names that contain relevant keywords can help, provided your site doesn&rsquo;t fit the profile of a spam site or link farm. Example: <code>cookingforone.com</code> for recipes designed for one person.  However, if choosing between an exact-match domain and a recognizable brand name, go with the brand name and focus on optimizing the site itself.</li>
				<li><strong>Search intent:</strong> try to understand what users are actually searching for when they use specific keywords.  Keywords will change depending on whether they want to:
					<ul>
						<li>Find a particular website (navigational)</li>
						<li>Get the answer to a question (informational)</li>
						<li>Research information before making a purchase (investigational)</li>
						<li>Make a purchase (transactional)</li>
					</ul>
					Properly optimized sites will include content for each of these search types.</li>
				<li><strong>Content length:</strong> longer pages with more content will be ranked higher, within reason; don&rsquo;t pad your word count unnecessarily just to improve ranking, as this decreases the total content quality.</li>
				<li><strong>Page structure:</strong> set up your pages with relevant headings, properly tagged within the <code>h</code> tag hierarchy (<code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, etc.).  Make sure each page only has one <code>h1</code> tag, and that it contains the title of the page.</li>
				<li><strong>Meta descriptions:</strong> these will show up as a site&rsquo;s preview text in most search engines, when specified.  Limit these to 160 characters.</li>
				<li><strong>Social media shares:</strong> the more people share your content on social media, the higher your site will rank in search results.</li>
				<li><strong>Business information:</strong> if your site includes business contact details such as name, address, and phone number, has business listings on Google My Business and Facebook, has reviews linked to it, and uses local search terms if serving a local population, that will improve rankings as well.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Improving your ranking</h2>
			
			<p>There are many different factors in a site&rsquo;s rank.  Improving them can be broken into two methods: on-page techniques, and off-page techniques.</p>
			
			<h3>On-page techniques</h3>
			
			<p>There are seven essential places where SEO keywords need to appear:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Page title</li>
				<li>URL/web address</li>
				<li>Headings</li>
				<li>Text</li>
				<li>Link text</li>
				<li>Image alt text</li>
				<li>Meta descriptions</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>And here&rsquo;s a checklist of on-page techniques to improve SEO ranking:</p>
			
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-url">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-url"><strong>Have a human-readable URL that describes the page content.</strong><br>
					URLs are an excellent SEO tool, since you can put keywords directly into it. Example: <code>website.com/about-us/</code> rather than <code>website.com/page2.html</code>.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-https">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-https"><strong>Serve your website over HTTPS.</strong><br>
					Make sure your site has a valid SSL certificate and shows the little <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-lock-fill" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M8 1a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v4H6V3a2 2 0 0 1 2-2zm3 6V3a3 3 0 0 0-6 0v4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v5a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h6a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2z"/><title>padlock</title></svg> icon in the browser&rsquo;s URL toolbar.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-robots">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-robots"><strong>Add a <code>robots.txt</code> file.</strong><br>
					This tells search engine crawler bots where they can and can&rsquo;t look for your site&rsquo;s information.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-sitemap">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-sitemap"><strong>Add a sitemap file.</strong><br>
					The sitemap should be either in XML format, or a human-readable HTML page on your site.  It should list your entire site structure with links to each page.  If using a <strong>content management system</strong> (CMS) such as Wordpress, there are tools to auto-generate and auto-update your sitemap.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-load">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-load"><strong>Improve your page load speed.</strong><br>
					Pages that take longer than a few seconds to load have a significantly higher bounce rate as well as a significantly lower search result ranking.  Make sure your site loads quickly by using <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">Google&rsquo;s PageSpeed Insights tool</a>, <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly">test your site&rsquo;s mobile friendliness</a>, and use <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search Console</a> to see your highest priority improvement areas.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-mobile">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-mobile"><strong>Improve mobile device performance.</strong><br>
					Make sure your site is responsive and scales/rearranges effectively to suit different mobile screen sizes.  Use a readable, screen-friendly font that isn&rsquo;t too small, and make your navigation menus easy to find, access, and use.  If you have ads, make sure they&rsquo;re unobtrusive and don&rsquo;t cover any of the page&rsquo;s content.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-keywords">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-keywords"><strong>Add relevant and specific keywords to your site&rsquo;s content.</strong><br>
					Incorporating commonly searched keywords relevant to your subject matter into the content of the page itself will tell a crawler that your page is proportionally more relevant than a page without those keywords.  Use a tool such as <a href="https://optinmonster.com/refer/semrush/">SEMrush</a> to see which keywords you currently have a high rank for, and your ranking for keywords you&rsquo;re trying to improve your rank for.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-keyword-stuffing">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-keyword-stuffing"><strong>Avoid keyword stuffing.</strong><br>
					Don&rsquo;t just stuff your content chock full of keywords to the point that it stops being human-readable.  Incorporate them in natural language, make sure every keyword is relevant to your content, and duplicated as little as possible.  An example of keyword stuffing: &ldquo;We sell custom cigar humidors. Our custom cigar humidors are handmade. If you’re thinking of buying a custom cigar humidor, please contact our custom cigar humidor specialists at custom.cigar.humidors@example.com.&rdquo;</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-duplicate">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-duplicate"><strong>Avoid duplicate content.</strong><br>
					Each page on your site should have fresh, original content.  If you have multiple URLs for the same content (i.e. <code>website.com?dress=1234</code> and <code>website.com/dresses/1234</code>, add <code>&lt;link rel="canonical" href="[primary URL link]" /&gt;</code> to specify what the canonical URL should be.  Read <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/consolidate-duplicate-urls">Google&rsquo;s explanation of canonical URLs</a> and <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/canonicalization">Moz&rsquo;s documentation on how to implement them</a> for more information.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-expand">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-expand"><strong>Expand your site&rsquo;s content on each page.</strong><br>
					If you can write more on your pages&rsquo; subjects without decreasing the quality or repeating yourself, do that.  Research suggests pages with word counts over 2,000 get into the top 10 results more frequently.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-structure">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-structure"><strong>Verify a page&rsquo;s HTML structure and clean it up where needed.</strong><br>
					Heading tags should be organized like a document outline.  A page must only have one <code>h1</code> tag, which contains the title of the page.  All main headings are <code>h2</code> tags, subheadings within those are <code>h3</code>, and so on.  Wherever possible, use <a href="../html-css/semantic.html">Semantic HTML</a> to improve readability, accessibility, and maintainability.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-meta">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-meta"><strong>Add meta tags and descriptions to HTML page <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> sections.</strong><br>
					Limit meta descriptions to catchy, informative, and summative snippets of 160 characters or less.  Use other meta tags to specify site language, relevant subjects, authors, and other important details using the syntax <code>&lt;meta name="[property]" content="[value]"&gt;</code>.</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-alt">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-alt"><strong>Add useful alt text and aria labels to images and background images.</strong><br>
					If an image is purely decorative, the alt text or aria label should be present but empty.  If an image contains text that is not repeated in the immediately neighboring content, include that text in the alt text or aria label.  If an image is descriptive, illustrative, or otherwise important, describe it in such a way that a visually impaired person will understand the content of the image.  Keep these as simple and objective as possible.  Example: &ldquo;A brown dog looking at the camera&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;A dark tan brindle mutt looks wistfully at the viewer, hoping to play fetch or go on a walk sometime soon.&rdquo;</label>
			</div>
			<div class="form-check">
				<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="seo-links">
				<label class="form-check-label" for="seo-links"><strong>Include link target information within the link text.</strong><br>
					Make sure any internal or outgoing links include information about the link&rsquo;s target (example: <a href="#">more information on giraffe migration patterns</a>) rather than just <a href="#">click here</a>.</label>
			</div>
			
			<h3>Off-page techniques</h3>
			
			<p>The best way to improve your SEO ranking with external factors is to make sure that a lot of relevant, reputable, and high-ranking sites link to yours.  Ideally, inbound links will come from sites with similar subject matters; for a site selling fish bait, an inbound link from an angling community is more important than a link from a hairdresser.</p>
			
			<p>Posting about your content on social media, especially in a way that other users are likely to share and repost it, will help as well.  But ultimately, one of the best ways to get more inbound links is just to give it time.  Keep publishing quality content and sharing it via social media, build a loyal audience, and give that audience time to grow.  As it grows, your inbound links will increase as well.  Interact with your audience, join forums relevant to your content and interact with people there, and make sure to use usernames linked to your site (i.e. your brand name).</p>
			
			<p>Paying for advertising, marketing, and influencer content is another way to drive up inbound links, traffic, and audience size, but can easily be abused and will be penalized by the algorithms.</p>
			
			<p>Focus on getting inbound links from high-quality sources, rather than the total quantity of inbound links.  One high-quality link will matter more than several low-quality links.  Here are the most effective methods to improve quality and quantity of inbound links:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Social networking:</strong> engage with your social media audience and get them talking about your brand.</li>
				<li><strong>Commenting:</strong> leave meaningful and useful comments on blogs and social posts relevant to your content to increase your visibility.</li>
				<li><strong>Forums:</strong> join and participate in forums and subreddits relevant to your topic.</li>
				<li><strong>Influencer outreach:</strong> build relationships with reputable influencers in your topic area, ask for their feedback and insight, and work with them to publish it.</li>
				<li><strong>Guest authors:</strong> feature guest authors on your site, and guest write for others.</li>
				<li><strong>Social bookmarking:</strong> promote your content on sites like StumbleUpon, Digg, and Reddit in relevant communities.</li>
				<li><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong> write thoughtful and useful answers on sites like Stack Overflow and Quora in your chosen topic.  Link back to your site when there&rsquo;s relevant content to share, just don&rsquo;t overdo it.</li>
				<li><strong>Newsletters:</strong> curate newsletters with recently published content, some exclusive content, and relevant information into easy-to-digest and short emails.  Publish them according to the local time of the largest slice of your audience, and avoid spamming them with emails.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Pleasing the audience or pleasing search engines</h2>
			
			<p>This depends on your site&rsquo;s goal.  Do you want to get your content in front of as many eyes as possible by using algorithms, or rely on crowd-sourced advertising by creating high quality content that your readers will share with new readers?</p>
			
			<p>Never sacrifice user experience and readability for better SEO ranking.  Annoying your audience will only decrease the metrics that determine your rank.  Google will never be your paying customer.  Your readers, however, might.</p>
