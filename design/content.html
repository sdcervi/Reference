			<h2 id="full-stack">Full stack content design</h2>
			
			<p>Before getting into the technical details of content design, it&rsquo;s important to address it from a full stack perspective. Full stack content design involves more than just proofreading or finding the right voice for your content; it isn&rsquo;t worth spending time polishing and refining content if it doesn&rsquo;t fit your audience and their needs.  A lot of projects that fail in the content design area fail because the product doesn&rsquo;t actually solve the problem it&rsquo;s supposed to solve.</p>
			
			<p>Full stack content design allows you to:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Scope out projects</li>
				<li>Decide on goals</li>
				<li>Research, test, iterate, and change</li>
				<li>Continue development and improvement through and after launch</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>The content design stack</h3>
			
			<p>The term <strong>full stack</strong> comes from the software development world, and is used to mean that someone can contribute to the success of a project at every stage of the work.  They may not be the best at a particular skill, but they have enough knowledge to know when to reach out to the people that <em>are</em> the best.  The content design stack is separated into three layers:</p>
			
			<div class="table-responsive">
			
				<table class="table table-bordered">
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th scope="col" class="col-4">SURFACE</th>
							<th scope="col" class="col-4">STRUCTURE</th>
							<th scope="col" class="col-4">SCOPE</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<ul>
									<li>Proofread and polish</li>
									<li>Voice and tone</li>
								</ul>
							</td>
							<td>
								<ul>
									<li>Usability</li>
									<li>Learnability</li>
									<li>Accessibility</li>
								</ul>
							</td>
							<td>
								<ul>
									<li>Research</li>
									<li>Problem definition</li>
									<li>Strategy and scope</li>
								</ul>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>

			</div>
			
			<h4>Scope</h4>
			
			<p>This is the bottom (first) layer, and is where everything should start.  This is where you define the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve, identify the resources you have available to use, and plan for the next step.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Research:</strong> working with the research team can help you identify words, phrases, metaphors, and cognitive pathways that your target audience uses. Integrating these into your final product will make it more intuitive and attractive to your users.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Problem definition:</strong> many teams start out trying to solve a different problem than the one that actually emerges from their research.  Write the problem as a story, and refine it over time as you progress.  A clear story helps unify different sub-teams and make communication between them eaiser, as well as making your project more sellable to leadership and management.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Strategy and scope:</strong> help your team avoid scope creep and stay focused.  Identify which aspects of the problem you&rsquo;ll be focusing on, and which you won&rsquo;t be addressing.</p>
			
			<h4>Structure</h4>
			
			<p>The Structure layer is where you organize content, categorize it, and sort it into hierarchies.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Usability:</strong> properly designed content needs a minimal cognitive load to process and use it.  Good usability also means consistency throughout the product and with other similar experiences elsewhere.  Use the language, metaphors, and symbols that your audience already uses so there&rsquo;s a base level of familiarity as soon as they see the content.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Learnability:</strong> think about what parts of your design might require explanations, clarification, or practice for people to use comfortably.  Minimize the learning curve by using already-familiar language and concepts.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> your content won&rsquo;t be usable or learnable if it isn&rsquo;t accessible.  Additionally, accessibility for one group is accessibility for everyone.  Think about a wheelchair ramp; it helps not just wheelchair users, but bicyclists and parents with strollers too.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Words need to be readable, whether it&rsquo;s on the screen or through an assistive device</li>
				<li>Word choice needs to be at a level users can understand; aim for plain language without any technical jargon</li>
				<li>Colors and contrast needs to improve readability and not take away from it</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Test early, test often:</strong> don&rsquo;t get attached to <em>any</em> design or content elements at this stage. You may find that you need to completely scrap a design and start over if it doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem the user needs to solve.  Bring real users in for testing frequently at all stages of the project.  You can even use low-fidelity markers like an off-brand font (Comic Sans, anyone?) or deliberately sketch-like/pixellated images to remind users and developers that this is a work in progress.  <strong>FPO</strong> (for placement only) overlays on images and behind text can have the same effect.</p>
			
			<p>Check out <a href="/accessibility/basics.html">Accessibility Basics</a> for more information on implementing accessibility principles in web interfaces.</p>
			
			<h4>Surface</h4>
			
			<p>This is where the content is refined and finalized; apply the finishing touches, double-check it against the style guide, and make sure it fits the project&rsquo;s narrative arc.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Proofread and polish:</strong> finalize the verbal, visual, and structural choices.  Make sure they&rsquo;re consistent with your in-house style guide for spelling, grammar, punctuation, and form.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Voice and tone:</strong> voice is who/what your organization is, and tone is how you communicate it.  Tone may shift depending on context.  Are you writing an informational article, a marketing email, or a radio ad?</p>
			
			<h2 id="page">Page content and layout</h2>

			<p>Webpages often have a lot of information to pack into a relatively small space.  Some of this is each page&rsquo;s unique content, but a good portion of it will be reused on multiple pages.  Organize and prioritize your content so that your message is clearly communicated and users can find what they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
			
			<p>Page content examples:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Header with logo, website name, and navigation links</li>
				<li>Links to related content and other relevant articles</li>
				<li>The page&rsquo;s unique content</li>
				<li>Login or membership options</li>
				<li>Subscription forms</li>
				<li>Comment sections, on articles and blog posts</li>
				<li>Copyright information</li>
				<li>Footer links: privacy policy, terms and conditions, advertising information, RSS feeds, important links</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Create a <strong>visual hierarchy</strong> of content to allow users to quickly scan the page for relevant information.  <strong>Grouping</strong> content into blocks of similar content will also help users identify each block&rsquo;s general purpose and subject without having to individually look at each item within the block.</p>
			
			<p>Similar elements in a page, such as buttons, should have similar styles so that users can quickly identify them and associate their function with their appearance.</p>
			
			<h2 id="hierarchy">Visual hierarchy</h2>
			
			<p>Use contrast between colors, sizes, and styles to help define a visual hierarchy within a page.  Items with higher contrast or a larger size are usually processed first.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Color:</strong> Foreground and background colors will help draw attention to specific key items such as links and buttons.  Bright colors or high-contrast pairings tend to grab attention most effectively.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Size:</strong> Larger elements take up more visual weight on the page, and will grab attention first.  Make headings and key points a larger text size.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Style:</strong> Make elements a different font weight, color, or font to help them stand out.  For example, make text <strong>bold</strong> or <code>a different font</code>.</p>
			
			<h2 id="grouping">Grouping and similarity</h2>
			
			<p>Organize visual elements into groups to show that they&rsquo;re related and relevant to one another.</p>
			
			<div class="row row-cols-2 row-cols-lg-3 row-cols-xxl-6 g-4 mb-4">
				
				<div class="col">
					<div class="card h-100">
						<img src="../assets/content-design/proximity.svg" class="card-img-top" alt="">
						<div class="card-body">
							<h5 class="card-title">Proximity</h5>
							<p class="card-text">Elements that are close together are seen as more related than elements placed farther apart. You can also nest groups of information within larger groups this way.</p>

							<p class="card-text">Elements placed together that follow a line or curve will be seen as more related than elements that don&rsquo;t.  This can also be used to direct the eye through a design.</p>

						<img src="../assets/content-design/color.svg" class="card-img-top" alt="">
						<div class="card-body">
							<h5 class="card-title">Color</h5>
							<p class="card-text">Giving element groups a background color can help frame them into visually distinct groups.  This works with nested groups as well.</p>

						<img src="../assets/content-design/border.svg" class="card-img-top" alt="">
						<div class="card-body">
							<h5 class="card-title">Borders</h5>
							<p class="card-text">Drawing a border around element groups can both indicate that they&rsquo;re related, and also separate the group from neighboring elements and groups.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				
			</div>
			
			<p>Elements that are similar to each other are perceived to be more related to each other than elements that are different.  Repeat color, size, orientation, texture, font, shape, etc. to help convey that matching elements have similar importance or meaning.  Consistency across similar blocks of content (i.e. article preview cards) will help with readability.</p>
			
			<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>
			
			<p>Good site navigation follows these principles:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Concise:</strong> Quick and easy to read.  Limit the number of options to no more than eight links, ideally fewer.  A good rule of thumb is the 3x5 rule: Five links with three sub-links each, or three links with five sub-links each.</li>
				<li><strong>Clear:</strong> The link text should make it obvious what kind of information is on the target page, and in as few words as possible.  For example: <a href="#">About Us</a> rather than <a href="#">History and Mission</a>.</li>
				<li><strong>Selective:</strong> The primary navigation should only reflect the main sections of the site.  Don&rsquo;t load it up with links to every single page, search bars, login bars, and links to legal information such as Terms and Conditions.</li>
				<li><strong>Context:</strong> Change the styling of the active section to help users know where they are on the site.  This can either be through color or text styling, with a visual indicator like an arrow, or both.</li>
				<li><strong>Interactive:</strong> Links should be large enough to easily click on, and the styling should change to cue the user that they are clickable.  The nav section should also be visually distinct from the rest of the page; for example, a colored bar behind the links.</li>
				<li><strong>Consistent:</strong> Keep the primary and tertiary (footer) navigation the same across the entire site.  Secondary navs can change depending on the section of the site, but the visual appearance and location should be consistent between sections.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Large sites may have secondary and even tertiary navigation menus.  Primary navs are usually at the top of the page, secondary navs are typically under the primary nav or down the side of the page, and tertiary navs usually live in the footer.</p>
