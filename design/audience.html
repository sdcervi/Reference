			<h2>Identify who the site is for</h2>
			
			<p>Digital and print designs (brochures, websites, apps, etc.) should always be designed for the target audience&mdash;not just for yourself.  This makes identifying your target audience essential to producing an effective and useful design.  Here are some possible audience traits:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Locale:</strong> Is the design intended for a small local audience, statewide, countrywide, worldwide...?  Other locales could be more context-based, such as urban or rural, big city or small town.</li>
				<li><strong>Age range:</strong> This can be either the age in years, or stage in life.</li>
				<li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male, female, nonbinary, transgender, etc.  This may be particularly relevant for social activism or health and medical content.</li>
				<li><strong>Language:</strong> Designs can be adapted easily to different spoken and written languages, but the primary language of your users may govern some design decisions.  These can include page weighting left or right, depending on the reading direction of the primary language.</li>
				<li><strong>Income:</strong> Lower-income users will have a different perception of price, value, and opportunity cost than higher-income users.  For example, deep sale markdowns on an ecommerce site will appeal to thrifty and budget-conscious users.</li>
				<li><strong>Education:</strong> Tailoring your content to a lower or higher level of education will help it be more relatable and digestible.  Technical documents can use more jargon, but blogs should be written more for a general audience, and usually with a more standard vocabulary.</li>
				<li><strong>Marital or family status:</strong> Adults caring for children will have different browsing and shopping habits than those without.</li>
				<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Users and readers with disabilities and impairments will need to interact with your content in different ways.  If you expect a large portion of your users to be using assistive devices and software, build your designs to work effectively with those systems.</li>
				<li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Whether it&rsquo;s a passion or simply a job to pay the bills, this can affect how a user or reader interacts with certain types of content.</li>
				<li><strong>Hours worked per week:</strong> People that work long hours and/or long weeks will often not have as much time or attention span to read content.  Consider formatting your content as easily digestible, small chunks broken up by logical headings to make it quicker for these users to visually scan your designs.</li>
				<li><strong>Web usage:</strong> People who are on the web a lot tend to be more up to date on memes, trends, and current news.</li>
				<li><strong>Device:</strong> Based on <a href="../resources/statistics.html">web usage statistics</a>, most users aren&rsquo;t using the latest, fastest Mac computers with Retina displays and multiple monitors.  The data skews more toward 1080p Windows laptops, Android phones, and iPhones around five to six years old.</li>
				<li><strong>Technical competency:</strong> Very few users and readers have the same level of technical experience, knowledge, and skill as the designer.  Make sure designs follow a logical flow and are straightforward to use for someone who may struggle with what you consider basic tasks on a device.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Even if your audience covers a broad array of different traits, it can still help to identify specific use cases or user profiles.  Telling stories of how a specific user may nagivate your design can call attention to errors you may not have otherwise seen.</p>

			<p>If you have questions about how a particular feature or design element will be used, think about your use cases and ask how one of your identified users would react to that particular design.</p>
			
			<h2>Identify why people will visit your site</h2>
			
			<p>A website&rsquo;s content and design should be influenced by two main factors:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Motivations:</strong> Is this just for entertainment or is it just for a specific goal?  If they have a specific goal, is it personal or professional?  Is visiting your website essential, or a luxury?</li>
				<li><strong>Goals:</strong> What makes your visitor come to your site at this exact moment?  Is there information they&rsquo;re after?  Is that information time sensitive?  Are they researching something they&rsquo;re already aware of, or wanting to learn about something new?  Do they need to contact you, and if so, how?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Examples</h3>
			
			<p><strong>Gordon</strong> bought a tennis racquet several years ago, and now he wants to buy one from your site for his girlfriend.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Molly</strong> read about your new doggy daycare in the newspaper and wants to find out if it will fit her needs.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Jasper</strong> had a bad experience staying in a hotel when visiting Sydney, Australia, and wants to make a complaint.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Ayo</strong> hopes to study architecture and wants to learn more about a new course being offered at your university.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Ivy</strong> is a photo editor and wants to look at a photographer&rsquo;s portfolio for examples of his work before deciding whether to commission work from him.</p>
			
			<h2>What information your visitors need</h2>
			
			<p>Work out what information your users are looking for so that they can achieve their goals quickly, easily, and effectively.  Prioritize this information in your site hierarchy to make it easier to find; background and related information can be presented in sidebars and insets.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Are they familiar with your subject area/brand or do you need to introduce it to them?</li>
				<li>Are they familiar with the product/service/information you cover, or do they need background information on it?</li>
				<li>What are the most important features of what you are offering?  Frame this from the end user&rsquo;s perspective.</li>
				<li>What is special about what you offer that differentiates you from other sites that offer something similar?</li>
				<li>Once people have achieved the goal that brought them to your site, are there common questions people ask about this subject area?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>How often the content needs updating</h2>
			
			<p>Depending on your subject area, your website may need to refresh its content more or less frequently.  For example, news and fashion sites will need fresh content more frequently than sites for services such as plumbing or roofing.  Setting a schedule for this may be helpful to avoid burn-out from ad hoc updates.</p>
			
			<p>Some parts of your site may need more frequent updating than others; for example, if you have a static site with a news feed, only the news feed will need fresh content.  Additionally, keep in mind whether your users will be returning for regular updates on your subject matter, or if they only need to access the information once.</p>
